        <h1>Team c00lkidd</h1>
        <p>Team c00lkidd was an infamous Roblox exploiting group active from approximately 2014 to 2016, known for vandalizing
        popular games using a hacking script called the "c00lgui". The group and its leader have since been banned from Roblox,
        but their legacy persists in the community through fan groups, merchandise, and appearances in other games.</p>
